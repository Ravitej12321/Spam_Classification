# Spam Classification of BOW and TF-IDF

This project implements a spam email classification system using two popular text representation methods: Bag of Words (BOW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The goal is to classify emails as spam or not using machine learning models.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-classification-bow-tfidf.git
    cd spam-classification-bow-tfidf

2. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook spam_classification.ipynb

4. Steps in the Notebook:

    * Load and preprocess the dataset.
    * Choose between Bag of Words (BOW) or TF-IDF for text representation.
    * Train a model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
    * Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    * Modify the notebook to experiment with different models, preprocessing, or hyperparameters.
